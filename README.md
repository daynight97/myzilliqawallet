# myzilliqawallet
A client-side wallet for Zilliqa.

This is a wallet for Zilliqa which can completely run on your own computer/PC without the need to connect to a server. Download the code, extract to a folder called myzilliqawallet (or any name you want) and then click sendtoken.html. That's all you need to do. 

The wallet wallet can run entirely client side. When you want to unlock your wallet, make sure you turn off your internet (airplane mode) so that any trojan/virus won't be able to send out any info via internet. Only after the wallet is unlocked, then reconnect your internet (toggle airplane mode), and send your token as desired.
