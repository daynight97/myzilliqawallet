# myzilliqawallet
A true 100% open source client-side wallet for Zilliqa.

This is a wallet for Zilliqa which can completely run on your own computer/PC without the need to connect to a server. Download the code, extract to a folder called myzilliqawallet (or any name you want) and then click sendtoken.html. That's all you need to do. 

By default it will connect to Zilliqa official node https://api.zilliqa.com/, but you can specify other node you want to connect to. 

The wallet can run entirely on client side (which means your own computer/laptop). To run the wallet, you do not need to install any software. Just download the latest source from release (https://github.com/daynight97/myzilliqawallet/releases/).

When you want to unlock your wallet, make sure you turn off your internet (airplane mode) so that any trojan/virus/keyboard logger won't be able to send out any info via internet. Only after the wallet is unlocked, then reconnect your internet (toggle airplane mode), and send your token as desired. 

DISCLAIMER
This software is still under testing, use it at your own risk. Any feedback/bug report is welcome.
